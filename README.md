# MNIST-Digit-Classifier

This Repository contains Models to classify Handwritten Digit Dataset(MNIST) using pytorch

The first pyTorch model is a Multi Layer Perceptron Model which classifies Handwritten Digits

The second pyTorch model is programmed using Convolution Neural Networks

The Final task of the internship is to build MNIST digit classifier using Residual Networks
